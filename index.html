		<h2>Homework part one: Creative dataviz critique</h2>

		<p>Instructions: Choose one of the following creative dataviz stories, and carefully consume it, both text and creative elements. Make sure you spend time fully with each element. Then, critique it. Below the instructions, you should write the name of the project inside an h3 tag, and write at least three paragraphs and insert them below inside three separate p tags. Don't forget to close your tags!</p>
		<h3>Choose from one of these projects:</h3>
		<ul>
			<li><a href="https://pudding.cool/2018/08/pockets/" target="_blank">Women's pockets</a>, The Pudding</li>
			<li><a href="https://graphics.reuters.com/INDIA-POLLUTION/01008173281/index.html" target="_blank">Pollution in Delhi</a>, Reuters Graphics</li>
			<li><a href="https://egyptbuildingcollapses.org/#" target="_blank">Building collapses in Egypt</a>, <a href="https://alternative-narratives-vis-archive.com/case_studies/egypt-building-collapses" target="_blank">Tactical Technology Collective</a></li>
			<li><a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/resources/idt-7464500a-6368-4029-aa41-ab94e0ee09fb" target="_blank">COVID deaths through sound</a>, BBC</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Answer <i>at least</i> the following questions, and be thorough and detailed in your responses: Where is the data from in this project, and what dataviz/graphics/visual elements are used? What do you think is the key message of this dataviz project? Describe the different ways in which this dataviz project is effective at conveying its key message. Mona Chalabi talks about her dataviz projects being visceral, or having to do with deep, internal feelings rather than the intellect, in order to be memorable -- in what ways do you feel this dataviz project was visceral?</p>

		<h3>Women's pockets, The Pudding<h3>
			<p>I looked at the story on women’s pockets from The Pudding. My first reaction was that the graphic elements in this story were really aesthetically pleasing without being distracting or too much to look at. The interactivity in the title was a really great idea, and it helps draw the reader in right from the beginning. It’s really creative. Additionally, overall I think the graphics are really simple to understand – even though it’s an alternative and more unusual graphic style, like not a typical chart, it’s still a very intuitive design that readers can easily understand. I also think it’s good that they kept the same style of graphics/dataviz throughout the story. By sticking with the same model, they made it even easier for readers to understand.<p>
			<p>My biggest issue with the graphics and dataviz is that the initial two or so graphics have no units or scale. While visually, the graphics and dataviz still allow readers to understand the general idea, when the article is discussing something like a measurement or size, units and scale are critical. I wasn’t able to really get a grasp on the size of the comparison until the third graphic or so.<p>
			<p>The most useful graphics to me were the fifth ones where readers could select a commonly-carried object and see how it fit in women’s versus men’s pockets, and could even see the specifics of how it would work for each pair of pants. It gave the most context and was a really interesting comparison. It also made it really easy for me to comprehend the size of the pockets because I had an understanding of the objects listed.<p>





		<h2>Homework part two: Datawrapper chart</h2>

		<p>Instructions: Choose one of the following datasets -- one of which we've used in the past -- to create one, fully complete Datawrapper chart or map, that reflects at least one finding from this dataset. Insert it below the instructions inside an iframe tag.</p>
		<p>Attributes of a fully complete Datawrapper chart: Hed, subhed, data source, alt text, legend, byline, any notes about data limitations or details, any annotations that you feel help convey your finding(s). Remember: your finding should be reflected in either your hed or subhed, and an explanation of your data (where it's from, what it collects, etc.) should be reflected in the other. You must choose colors from a color palette generator; you may not use Datawrapper's default colors.</p>
		<h3>Choose from one of these datasets:</h3>
		<ul>
			<li><a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1kAtkOoa15IdWrdgNc-3rSP6in--SX8m-/edit?rtpof=true" target="_blank">Active duty troops</a>, Stimson Center</li>
			<li><a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1RZ235-x4KYuyA7xQX-flOP-N5uvweIMh9qPh4FN2fLo/edit#gid=0" target="_blank">NY data</a>, Mapping The Gay Guide</li>
		</ul>

		<!-- Insert your iframe tag, with your embed code inside, here: -->
<iframe title="Number of Countries Per United States Military Command Region" aria-label="Bar Chart" id="datawrapper-chart-QNyH2" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/QNyH2/1/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="491"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var a in e.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data["datawrapper-height"][a]+"px"}}}))}();
</script>
  
  		
  		<p>When you're done with both parts of this homework, return to Blackboard assignment step #4, and follow the instructions to get this on your Github page.</p>
